# Follow-Spot

I made this Follow-Spot bc I had a random mini projector lamp lying around and a broken camera lens so I wanted to take it and turn it into a spotlight that can follow any subject using open CV and an old action cam.

Note:
I had to use Ai for a small bit of the open cv code since when I was implementing the serial comms it did not work no matter what I did and always crashed so ai just fixed a line of code for me.
